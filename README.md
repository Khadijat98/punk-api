# Punk API
** Made by Khadijat Oyeleye**

This is an app which draws, searches and filters through information from the Punk API using React. It is styled with SCSS.

This project was created in week 6 of the _nology course. The aim was to gain experience with using React and REST APIs.

### Known Bugs
1. When selected first, the filter for the pH does not update the page properly when one or both of the other filters are also selected. This is probably because the ABV and date filters use url params, which change the information brought onto the page from the API, while the pH filter only changes the array that is already on the page.

2. The search box only searches for the beers that are already on the page, not the ones that are brought in from the API when the ABV or date filters are selected.

### Summary
Overall, I am satisfied with the progress I made with this project, as I managed to tackle the extensions. The future improvements I plan to make for this project are to fix the bugs.
